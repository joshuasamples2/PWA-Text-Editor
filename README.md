# PWA-Text-Editor
```md
  Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) blend the benefits of a traditional browser experience with those of a mobile application. PWAs use the Service Worker and Cache APIs to cache assets and API responses, which ensures that the application will continue to work without an internet connection.

  Many of the tools and technologies used to create PWAs can be leveraged to help improve application performance and accessibility. One of these tools is services workers, which can be used to cache static CSS, JavaScript, HTML files, images, and even API requests. This allows developers to reduce network bandwidth and improve overall load times.

## Tasks 
````md
 My task was build a simple text editor with JavaScript syntax highlighting. The text editor is a Progressive Web Application, which enables users to install and use it offline. The application was bundled with webpack and took advantage of Babel to use modern JavaScript on the browser.
